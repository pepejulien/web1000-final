   Divide  Conquer Combine Return
   
2.  Using JavaScript, generate a random number between 50 and 100.
    Math.random()*50+50
    
3.  Using Javascript, generate a random number between -100 and 100.
    Math.random()*200-100
    
4.  Write a coin flip function. It should return the string "heads" half the time and the string "tails" the other half
       function coinFlip(){
        if(Math.floor(Math.random()*2) === 0){
          return "heads"
        }
        return "tails"
       };
       
5.  Re-state the following expression without using negation: !(10 > x)
    10 <= x
    
6.  Re-state the following expression without using negation: !(a > 10 && b <= 5)
    a <= 10 || b > 5
    
7.  Re-state the following expression without repeating variable a: (a && x <= 10) || (a && y < 0)
    ********************
    
8.  Re-state the following expression without negations: !( (a > 10) || (b > 10) || (c > 10) || (isAdmin) )
    a <= 10 && b <= 10 && c >= 10 && !isAdmin
    
9.  Write a function which, given a 2-d array of strings, returns the concatenation of all the strings.
    ********************
10.  Write a function which, given a 2-d array and another value x, returns true if x is present in the 2-d array, and false otherwise.
    ********************
    
11. Write a function which, given an two sorted arrays of sizes m and n, returns a larger sorted array of size m+n. This function must work in O(m+n) time.
    ********************
    
12.  Given the following edge list, draw the graph. Use MS Paint and include the file in your repo.
